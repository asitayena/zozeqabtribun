Given that the second season has just been released, it’s still too early to expect another season anytime soon. However, if the second season is well-received by viewers, there’s a high chance that the third season will be renewed. If that happens, the release date will likely be in 2024, given the show’s previous release pattern.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SexLife_Season_3_Renewal_Status></span>Sex/Life Season 3 Renewal Status<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of this writing, there has been no official confirmation regarding the renewal status of Sex/Life Season 3.
