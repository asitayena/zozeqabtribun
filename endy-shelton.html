After working together, fate decided it as they got infatuated and fell in love.</p><p>The duo started dating in 2015 and dropped several albums, including the chart-topping country hits Happy Anywhere and Nobody Like You. After being together for over five years, it was finally time for one of them to pop the question.</p><p>Blane, being the man he always is, took the initiative and proposed in October 2020.
