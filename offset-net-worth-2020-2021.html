From the very first day till today, he has been with this group. Migos is a successful music group which gave a thriving career to Offset. Over his one-decade-long career, he has amassed huge popularity and remarkable net worth.</p><p>Maybe you know about Offset very well But do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Offset’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early life</h2><p>Born as Kiari Cephus, Offset is an American rapper and co-founder of hip-hop group ‘Migos’. He was born on 14 December 1991, in Lawrenceville, US. There is not any confirmed information about his parents and education. However, the other two members of the Migos group are said to be his relatives. Quavo is said to be his cousin while Takeoff, the third member, is said to be his nephew.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Speaking of his private life, Offset is a kind of expressive man. Recently, he proposed his girlfriend Cardi B, who is also a rapper, in quite a filmy style. He proposed her at a live performance with a ring worth of $500,000. Before this relationship, Offset has been into a few other relationships. He has three children with his ex-girlfriends. Nevertheless, the singer isn’t married yet.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 14 December 1991, Offset is 32 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.74 m tall, and weight is 70 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Offset belongs to a middle-class family, so making a career at international level was surely nail-biting for him. But as he was passionate about hip-hop music since childhood, he didn’t lose the hope and started making efforts for his dreams.</p><p>In 2009, he came together with two other boys, who both belonged to the same town and had the same upbringings as offset, and formed a hip-hop music group ‘Polo Club’ which was later renamed to ‘Migos’ in 2010. In the initial years, he didn’t have smooth sailing, but as time passed, people started recognising his talents.</p><p>After changing the name of the group in 2010, he released the first group tape in 2012, but it didn’t grab much attention. He and his group got the initial recognition in 2013 when the single song ‘Versace’ was released.</p><p>It was loved by the audience and has even made a place on Billboards list. But his career took a leaf in 2014 when the second mixtape titled ‘No Label 2’ was released. For this tape, Offset was particularly praised. Then, in 2015, Migos released its first album that went on becoming the number 3 on the list of the ‘Top Rap Albums Charts’. With this group album, Offset tasted the mainstream of success.</p><p>Just two years after the groundbreaking success of his debut studio album, Offset released second group album named ‘Culture’ in 2017 which reached even at number 1 spot on Billboard list.</p><p>Other than the singing, Offset also appeared in an episode of T series Atlanta.</p><h2>Awards & achievements</h2><p>Offset has given all the songs with his team members for their group Migos, so individually, he hasn’t won any awards. But his group Migos has won several nominations and awards including the BET Award.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Offset in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Offset-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Offset has been around just for a while. He certainly started his career in 2009, but it garnered attention in 2013. So, in just five years, you can’t expect a huge net worth from Offset. But if we consider the fact that he gave a ring worth of $500,000 to his girlfriend, then he must have a net worth.</p><p>As of July 2024, he holds an impressive net worth of $30 million. Looking at his career’s time span, this is remarkable net worth. He has made all this money through the singing. If we talk about his net worth in coming years, it will surely upsurge in future as his music band Migos is at the peak of success.</p><p>Though Offset got involved in a couple of legal troubles, he managed to move on and focus on his professional career. He has even achieved success after that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLynstKeq2amlal6uLvRrZ9mamBnfW5%2Bj2toaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./parker-nirenstein.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Parker Nirenstein Net Worth | Girlfriend">&larr;
