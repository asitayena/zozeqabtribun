At his death, Haskins was playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers and earning an annual salary of over $6 million and a $1 million bonus.</p><p>He was signed to a three-year contract with the Steelers that was set to expire in 2023. Haskins’ salary and contract reflected his potential as a quarterback, which some saw as a risky investment for the Steelers.</p><p>Dwayne Haskins net worth was a result of his hardwork and dedication.</p><p>The team was willing to pay him a significant amount of money in the hopes that he would develop into a top-tier player.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his promising career prospects, Haskins’ life was tragically cut short in the car accident. His death shocked the NFL <a href=#>community</a> and his fans, who mourned the loss of a talented athlete.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the end of his career, Haskins net worth and earnings remain a testament to his skill and potential as a player.</p><p>In the 2019 NFL draft, Haskins was selected by the Washington Redskins (now Washington Commanders) as the 15th overall pick in the first round.&nbsp;</p><p>Although jersey number 7 had been unofficially retired by the team to honor Joe Theismann, Haskins was granted the number after making a request.</p><p>Dwayne Haskins debuted as a quarterback for the Washington Football Team in Week 4 against the New York Giants. Despite throwing 107 passing yards, Haskins also threw three interceptions, and Washington lost 24-3 to the Giants.</p><p>In week 9, Haskins made his first-ever start for Washington in a game against the Buffalo Bills, and Washington lost 24-9.</p><p>However, in week 12, Haskins got his first win as a starter when Washington defeated the Detroit Lions with a score of 19-16.&nbsp;During the 2020 season, Haskins was named one of Washington’s team captains and starters.</p><p>Despite this, Haskins’ performance in the 2020 season was inconsistent, and he was eventually replaced as Washington’s starting quarterback by veteran Alex Smith.</p><p>In December 2020, Haskins was fined $40,000 and stripped of his captaincy after he was photographed violating <a href=#>COVID-19</a> protocols by attending a party without a mask.&nbsp;</p><p>The following day, he was demoted to the third-string quarterback. On December 28, 2020, Washington Football Team released Haskins after a disappointing stint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Dwayne-Haskins-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dwayne Haskins net worth- Salary of Dwayne Haskins</h2><p>Dwayne Haskins, the starting quarterback for the Washington Football Team,&nbsp;was scheduled to earn a significant salary this season.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, he signed a four-year contract worth $14.4 million, which included a guaranteed salary of $10.4 million.&nbsp;</p><p>His salary for the 2022 season was approximately $6 million, substantially increased from the $2.8 million he earned in his rookie season.&nbsp;However, Haskins’ salary has sparked controversy in recent months.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have questioned why the Washington Football Team invested so much in a quarterback. Others have argued that his salary is reasonable, given the rising costs of quarterbacks across the league.</p><p>The team’s commitment to Haskins is evident in his salary, but only time will tell if their gamble will pay off. This has led to an increase in Dwayne Haskins net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dwayne Haskins net worth- assets investments</h2><p>Dwayne Haskins has an array of assets, which include two <a href=#>real estate</a> properties, four cars, and a luxury yacht.</p><p>Additionally, he has cash reserves exceeding $1 million. According to sources, Haskins also has an investment portfolio of 1,012 stocks valued at $10 million.</p><p>Haskins’ financial situation is subject to change, as the values of his assets may fluctuate due to various factors such as market conditions, depreciation, or maintenance costs.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Haskins cause of death&nbsp;</h2><p>Dwayne Haskins, a first-round pick for Washington in 2019 who was with the Steelers in 2021, died from blunt force trauma after being hit while walking across the westbound lanes of Interstate 595 near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport.</p><p>A lawsuit filed on behalf of Dwayne Haskins’ wife and parents alleges that the former NFL quarterback was drugged, blackmailed, and robbed before his death on a South Florida highway in April 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit names four individuals who allegedly drugged Haskins to blackmail and rob him, causing severe injury and death, but does not provide details on the allegations.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuit also claims that the dump truck driver who struck Haskins, Oriel Patino, was driving carelessly, exceeding the speed limit, and failing to maintain the brakes and tires on his truck.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the suit does not implicate Patino in the drugging, blackmailing, or robbing of Haskins. The lawsuit seeks damages against the defendants, but it is unclear what specific damages are being sought.&nbsp;</p><p>The allegations in the lawsuit have not been proven in court, and the defendants have not yet responded to the suit. The case remains ongoing, and further details may emerge as the legal proceedings continue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Memorial-Service-for-Dwayne-Haskins--1024x536.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The autopsy report</h2><p>According to reports from the medical examiner, two blood alcohol content samples taken from Dwayne Haskins showed readings of 20 and .24, which is triple the legal limit of .08 for driving in Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>The autopsy conducted by the Broward County Medical Examiner’s office listed the cause of Haskins’ death as “multiple blunt force injuries” and the manner of death as an “accident.”&nbsp;</p><p>The autopsy report stated that Haskins was traveling with a female companion in a vehicle that ran out of gas on the side of the I-595. He then left the car on foot to locate a gas station.</p><p>It is unclear whether Haskins was intoxicated when he left the vehicle, as the autopsy report did not mention his state of sobriety at that point.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the blood alcohol content samples taken after his death suggest that he had been drinking heavily before the accident.&nbsp;</p><p>The circumstances leading to Haskins’ death are tragic, and the findings from the autopsy and blood alcohol content samples serve as a reminder of the dangers of driving under the influence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Dwayne Haskins parents?</h2><p>Dwayne Haskins’ parents did not attend their son’s funeral due to issues with his wife, Kalabrya Gondrezick-Haskins. Instead, they plan to hold two services for their son in New Jersey in Maryland.&nbsp;</p><p>Dwayne Haskin was allegedly involved in an altercation with his wife last year, where she was accused of punching him in a Las Vegas hotel and casino.&nbsp;</p><p>The service for Haskins was held at the Allegheny Center Alliance Church in Pittsburgh, attended by most of the current Steelers team, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, and former Ohio State coach Urban Meyer.</p><p>At the service, Gondrezick-Haskins, one of the six speakers, draped herself over the casket after the emotional funeral.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCw1pqwp51dna60t8inqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dylan-barbour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dylan Barbour Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">&larr;
