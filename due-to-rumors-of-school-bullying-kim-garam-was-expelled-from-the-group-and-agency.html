In an official statement released on July 20 by HYBE and Source Music, it was stated that the company had chosen to discontinue its exclusive agreement with member Kim Garam, who had been the target of allegations of school bullying. Apparently, the agency:</strong></p><p>“The exclusive deal with Kim Garam has been terminated by our company.” We sincerely regret for causing worry due to the member’s conflict to our fans and those who have shown love and support to the group.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The agency will fully support LE SSERAFIM’s aspirations to develop as artists as it continues to operate as a five-person group.</p><h2><span id=Supporters_of_LE_SSERAFIM_respond_to_Kim_Garam_leaving_the_organization_and_group>Supporters of LE SSERAFIM respond to Kim Garam leaving the organization and group.</span></h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Supporters of LE SSERAFIM respond to Kim Garam leaving the organization and group.</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Who is LE SSERAFIM, exactly?</a></li></ul><p>The organization quickly followed the formal announcement with another brief statement in which it apologized for how it handled her bullying complaint.</p><p>The spokesman stated:</p><p>While the agency handled this problem and tried to operate with the utmost caution and care, it is clear that some aspects of its strategy were inadequate, and we regret that.</p><p>Fans of LE SSERAFIM responded to the news of the idol’s departure from the group and agency on social media. While some people were dissatisfied, others thought it was best for the company. Some expressed more sympathy, saying they hoped the former star would take this as a lesson and that the victim would have the strength to move on from her suffering.</p><p>Following the news, some fans made fun of the fact that other HYBE artists, such as Yeojun of TOMORROW X TOGETHER, would now replace her as the group’s sixth member.</p><p>In case our readers have forgotten, Kim Garam was linked to allegations of school violence prior to making her LE SSERAFIM debut in April. At the time, HYBE and Source Music released a statement denying the allegations, which had their origins in an online community that had been made public by an unnamed Person A claiming to be the victim.</p><p>At the time, HYBE and Source Music argued that the allegations of school violence were unfounded and vowed to sue the celebrity.</p><p>Person The ex-LE SSERAFIM member was accused of several offenses repeatedly, which altered the path of the investigation. As the allegations developed, more persons who identified themselves as the idol’s former classmates came forward with what they claimed to be evidence that Kim Garam was the cause of the school shooting.</p><p>After that, HYBE and Source Music declared they will stop all promotional efforts for three weeks. She is currently formally no longer employed by LE SSERAFIM and the organization. Since the agency also declared in May that they would not suspend the member, this is unexpected. The group of five people who make up the organization will now continue to run it.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_LE_SSERAFIM_exactly>Who is LE SSERAFIM, exactly?</span></h2><p>After Kim Garam left the group, it now consists of Sakura, Kim Chae-won, Huh Yun-jin, Kazuha, and Hong Eun-chae. The name of the group is an anagram of the phrase “I’m Fearless.” They made their public debut on <strong>May 2, 2022</strong>, with the publication of their debut EP, Fearless.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Gemma Collins Claimed Leonardo DiCaprio Ejected Her From A Nightclub</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Who Is Mady McLanahan From ‘Love Island’?</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfmcKmedOoZKutnaS%2FtHnOn2Ssm5ikvK15wa6jpbGZo7Rut8imZKCZopa6bsPArGSesKCaua2xw2adq6edYsGpsYygqaitoGKur7CMmp6eppOufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./georges-st-pierre-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Georges St-Pierre  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
