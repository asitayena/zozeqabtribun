His father was a coal miner. On his mother's side, he was related to several professional soccer players. His uncles were Jack Milburn, George Milburn, Jim Milburn, Stan Milburn, and Jackie Milburn. Charlton began playing soccer from a young age, encouraged by his mother and grandfather. His older brother, Jack, originally pursued a career as a miner and then policeman before also becoming a professional soccer player.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>While playing soccer at Bedlington Grammar School at the age of 15, Charlton was spotted by Joe Armstrong, the chief scout for Manchester United. He signed amateur forms with United in January 1953. He worked his way up the pecking order of the teams over the next few years before debuting with the top team in 1956. He played for United 17 times in his first season. He scored twice on his debut and managed 12 goals total over this period of time.</p><p>A couple of years later, in 1958, his team was on an airplane leaving the Munich airport when disaster struck. The plane clipped a fence while taking off and one of its wings caught on fire. The plane was cut in half and 23 people, including eight Manchester United players, died as a result. Charlton suffered some injuries but ultimately was able to return to the United Kingdom eight days after the crash.</p><p>Charlton returned to playing with Manchester United and the team kept improving more and more over the next years.
