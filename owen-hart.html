Stampede Wrestling, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation were among the companies for which he worked (WWF). Owen’s greatest success came in the WWF, where he competed under his own name as well as the ring name The Blue Blazer. At the age of 34, he died on May 23, 1999, from injuries sustained during his ring entrance at the WWF’s Over the Edge pay-per-view event in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, due to an equipment malfunction and subsequent fall from the rafters of Kemper Arena.</h3><h2>How much is Owen Hart’s Net Worth?</h2><p>Owen Hart was a professional wrestler who competed in the ring. According to estimates, his net worth was believed to be <strong>$14</strong> million before he died. Working with various wrestling foundations allowed Hart to gain a lot of money during his career. He was a well-known athlete in the industry who had a lot to contribute, whether as a player or a coach. His actual pay, on the other hand, is unknown. He was content with his earnings prior to his death. There is no information on his automobiles or home.</p><h2>Famous For:</h2><ul><li>Being considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time by many industry colleagues.</li><li>Being widely regarded as one of the best in-ring performers in the WWF; Fox Sports dubbed him a “genius”.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/owen-hart-holding-an-award-300x293.png><h2>Martha (Owen Hart’s Wife) Doesn’t Want Owen Hart Inducted Into The WWE Hall Of Fame:</h2><p>Owen Hart, a renowned WWE performer, died tragically and untimely 21 years ago. The season two finale of Vice’s Dark Side of the Ring documentary, which aired Tuesday, chronicled Hart’s life, career, and untimely death. Hart was supposed to battle The Godfather for the Intercontinental Championship while wearing his Blue Blazer gimmick. Hart was to be dropped from the rafters into the ring for his entrance. However, the harness line malfunctioned, and Hart was accidently triggered too soon. Medical professionals tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Hart, but it was too late.</p><p>There’s little doubt that Hart had a Hall of Fame-worthy career, given his achievements, in-ring work, legacy, and outstanding contributions to the wrestling industry. In an interview with Forbes, Martha Hart stated that she will not allow WWE to induct him into the Hall of Fame. “I would never let a company that I blamed for Owen’s death try to memorialize him, especially with a phony Hall of Fame that doesn’t exist,” she stated. “And there’s no such thing as a hall of fame.” It isn’t true. It isn’t there. There’s nowhere you can go to see it, but it’s there.” It’s all made up and made up for the sole goal of making money because they just do a show where they have a celebration and it’s just crazy.” Martha brought a wrongful death case against WWE after Owen’s death, and they settled for <strong>$18</strong> million.</p><h2>How was the Cause Of Death of Owen Hart?</h2><p>Owen Hart died on May 23, 1999, in Kansas City, Missouri, during the Over the Edge pay-per-view event, where he was scheduled to fight ‘The Godfather’ for the Intercontinental Championship. He was supposed to make a superhero entrance into the ring, in keeping with his new’superhero persona,’ to be displayed to his fans. He was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of Kemper Arena via harness and grapple line for an Intercontinental Championship contest against The Godfather. Hart dropped 78 feet (24 m) while being lowered into the ring, landing chest-first on the top rope (about a foot from the nearest turnbuckle) and being thrown into the ring. He was flown to Kansas City’s Truman Medical Center. Despite many attempts to resuscitate him, he died as a result of his injuries. Internal bleeding from blunt force injuries was later determined to be the cause of death.</p><h2>What is the birthplace of Owen Hart?</h2><p>Owen Hart was born on May 7, 1965, in Alberta, Canada, where he grew up. Owen James Hart was his real name and birth name. His ethnicity was Mixed and his nationality was Canadian. Hart’s ethnicity was White.

Via his maternal grandmother, he was of Greek ancestry, and through his maternal grandpa, he was of Irish ancestry.</p><p>His father’s ancestors were mostly Scots-Irish, but he also had Scottish and English ancestors. Hart was a dual citizen of Canada and the United States because his mother, Helen, was born in New York.
