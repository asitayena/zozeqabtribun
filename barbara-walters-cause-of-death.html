Walters continued to break ground for women in broadcasting in 1976 when she became the first female co-anchor of a network evening news program.</p><p>Walters was a co-host and producer on the ABC news magazine 20/20 for its entire run (1979-2004). Barbara Walters‚Äô annual ABC special, Barbara Walters‚Äô 10 Most Fascinating People also brought her fame. From Richard Nixon to Barack Obama, Walters spoke with both the president and first lady of the United States.

She had been aware of her aortic valve stenosis for quite some time. Despite the fact that she had been experiencing no symptoms. Walters‚Äôs spokeswoman <a href=# rel=noopener>Cindi Berger</a> reported four days after the procedure that the doctors were very pleased with the outcome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Barbara-Walters-Cause-of-Death-1.jpg><p>In September of 2010, Walters made her way back to The View and the Here‚Äôs <a href=# rel=noopener>Barbara</a> show on the Sirius XM satellite radio network.

She has been honored with a Women in Film Lucy Award, a Glaad Excellence in Media Award and Daytime and Prime Time Emmys.</p><p>The Walt Disney Company, the parent company of ABC, honored Walters with the Disney Legends award in 2008 for her exemplary service to the Disney brand. In the same year, she was honored by the New York Women‚Äôs Agenda with their Lifetime Achievement Award. Walters received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards on September 21, 2009 at Lincoln Center in New York City.</p><p>During the late 70s, on Saturday Night Live, Gilda Radner played a gentle parody of Walters as ‚ÄúBaba Wawa‚Äù highlighting Walters‚Äô distinctive speech with a rounded ‚ÄúR‚Äù reflecting Walters‚Äô status as a prominent figure in popular culture. The name ‚ÄòJane Doe‚Äô was a crossword clue on Monday, January 23, 1995.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The end of 2021 was the death of Betty White. Now, the end of 2022 is Barbara Walters. Iconic women üíî <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2ztrOB9QEk</a></p><p>‚Äî Wynn Westmoreland (@WynnWs) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 31, 2022</a></p><h2><strong>When did Barbara Walters publish her autobiography?</strong></h2><p>She used the often erroneous things people said to her in the late 1960s when writing her article ‚ÄúHow to Talk to Practically Anyone About Practically Anything‚Äù for a magazine. Doubleday expressed interest in turning the article into a book in a letter she received not long after it was published.</p><p>For Walters, it would be beneficial for tongue-tied socially awkward people. <strong>In 1970, she collaborated with June Callwood as a ghostwriter to release the book How to Talk with Practically Anyone about Practically Anything. </strong>The book‚Äôs success came as a shock to Walters. There were already eight printings and hundreds of thousands of copies in circulation around the world by 2008. It had also been translated into at least six different languages. Her autobiography, titled ‚ÄúAudition: A Memoir‚Äù was released in 2008 by Walters.</p><h2><strong>Barbara Walters Personal Life</strong></h2><p><strong>Four times, to three different men, Walters tied the knot.</strong> Her first husband, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant named Robert Henry Katz died in a car accident. They tied the knot on June 20, 1955, at New York City‚Äôs Plaza Hotel. After eleven months of marriage in 1957, it was supposedly dissolved. <a href=# rel=noopener>Lee Guber</a>, a theatre owner and producer was her second husband.</p><p>They tied the knot on Dec. 8, 1963 and later split up in 1976. There were three miscarriages for Walters before she and her husband decided to adopt a baby girl, Jacqueline Dena Guber born in 1968 and adopted the same year. Merv Adelson, CEO of Lorimar Television was her third husband. They tied the knot in 1981 and split up ten years later. They reconciled in 1992 after getting back together after their second divorce in 1986.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Barbara-Walters-Death-2-1.jpg><p>In college, Walters dated Roy Cohn, a lawyer Cohn claimed he proposed to Walters the night before she wed Lee Guber, but Walters always maintained that he never asked her out. She said that she would be loyal to Cohn forever because of how he had helped her adopt her daughter Jacqueline. Walters writes in her autobiography that she is thankful to Cohn for defending her father in court.</p><p>Walters claims that her father had an arrest warrant for failure to appear because he missed a court date in New York while the family was vacationing in Las Vegas, but that Cohn was able to get the charge dropped. In 1986, when Cohn was being tried for disbarment, Walters testified on his behalf as a character witness. Walters has romantically linked to United States Senator John Warner in the 1990s and dated future U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1970s.</p><p><strong>Must read our previous articles on these celebrities:</strong></p><p>In her autobiography Audition, Barbara Walters revealed that she had an affair with Edward Brooke, a married United States Senator from Massachusetts, in the 1970s. It‚Äôs unclear whether Walters like Jones was married at the time. According to Walters, they called it quits to avoid embarrassing themselves professionally. She began seeing Robert Neil Butler, a gerontologist and Pulitzer Prize winner, in 2007.</p><p>From the late 1960s until his death in 2017, Walters kept close friendships with Tom Brokaw, Woody Allen, Joan Rivers, and even the former head of Fox News, Roger Ailes.
