In this article, we’ll delve into Sue Aikens’ family life, her new home, and put to rest any rumors about her obituary or death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sue-Aikens-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sue_Aikens_Family_Ties_and_Tough_Beginnings></span><strong>Sue Aikens</strong> <strong>Family Ties and Tough Beginnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sue Aikens was born on July 1, 1963, in Chicago, Illinois. She’s now 60 years old and a proud Cancer zodiac sign. Sue’s life hasn’t been all glitz and glamour; she had a challenging start. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised in Palatine, Illinois, before embarking on a remarkable journey to Alaska.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sue-Aikens-son-Jesse-Aikens-family.jpg><p>When Sue was just twelve, her father left, and she and her mother found their way to Alaska. However, tragedy struck again when her mother passed away, leaving young Sue to fend for herself. It was in these harsh conditions that she learned the art of survival, including hunting with a gun, from an old Alaskan sourdough.</p><p>Despite her challenging upbringing, Sue managed to get a decent education. She attended the Lowell Whiteman School and completed high school at the age of thirteen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sue_Aikens_Career_and_Rise_to_Fame></span><strong><strong>Sue Aikens</strong> Career and Rise to Fame</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sue Aikens is a television personality and producer with several successful shows under her belt. She gained immense popularity when she took on the lead role in the documentary TV show “Life Below Zero,” which premiered in 2013. This series, which has won five Primetime Emmys, showcases how people survive the harsh Alaskan weather.</p><p>Besides “Life Below Zero,” Sue has made appearances in other adventurous TV series like “The Joe Rogan Experience” (2009), “Sarah Palin’s Alaska” (2010), “Flying Wild Alaska” (2011), and “Fox and Friends” (2014).

In February 2017, Sue filed a lawsuit against the show’s producers, claiming that her life was put in danger due to dangerous scenes and a lack of safety measures. She even mentioned emotional stress caused by her time on the show. Despite this, Sue has not left the series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sue_Aikens_Net_Worth></span><strong>Sue Aikens Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sue Aikens has earned a significant income through her work, particularly on “Life Below Zero,” where she is one of the highest-paid actors, earning approximately $4,500 per episode.

From these marriages, Sue has two children, Jennifer Payne and Jesse, who now have their own families.</p><p>Sue found love again and is currently in a long-distance relationship with Michael Heinrich, an electrician from New York. While they haven’t publicly discussed marriage plans, they continue to maintain their connection despite the miles between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sue-aiken-Michael-Heinrichs-7.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sue_Aikens_Current_Life></span><strong>Sue Aikens Current Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sue Aikens currently resides in a remote area of Alaska, nearly 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
