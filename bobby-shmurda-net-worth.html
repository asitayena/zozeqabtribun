Police claim they saw him flashing the gun in an apartment and when they went to investigate, he tried to hide it in his couch. He was set free on $10,000 bail. A few months later, he was arrested and charged along with 14 others, including his brother, with conspiracy to commit murder, reckless endangerment, and drug and gun possession. He pled guilty and was held on $2 million bail at Rikers Island jail. Police involved claimed they had been investigating the GS9 gang for murder and shooting indiscriminately at crowds in public places long before Shmurda rose to fame. Police said Shmurda was "the driving force" in GS9. In June of 2015, the rapper and his ex-girlfriend were caught by officials having smuggled a knife into Rikers Island. The pair were charged with two counts of promoting contraband, in addition to one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.</p><p>In 2016, Shmurda pled guilty to one count of weapons possession and one count of third-degree conspiracy. He was sentenced to seven years in prison which was changed to five years in prison and two years of probation. In early 2015, he was given a four-year sentence for sneaking a shiv into his cell. However, the sentence will run concurrently to his ongoing seven-year sentence, meaning he will not face additional jail time.</p><p>While imprisoned at Rikers, Shmurda was involved in multiple brawls, including a serious one between several inmates of the Bloods and Crips gangs that led him to losing phone privileges and was sent to solitary confinement for a month. In 2017, he was moved to Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York to finish his sentence in protective custody. He earns an average of $7.75 per week making 10 to 25 cents per hour while working in prison. He was released in February 2021 after serving six years in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX5e8o67YZqqhpaWnsaJ5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charlie-oconnell-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlie O'Connell Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
