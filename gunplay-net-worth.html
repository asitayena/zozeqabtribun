Known under his stage name of Gunplay, he is a popular rapper, who is famous for being one of the members of the hip hop band called “Triple C’s”. What is more, Gunplay is also known for his solo work, which he began in 2012. As his career in the music industry is not very long, Gunplay hasn’t won any awards yet, but he is only 35 years old now so there is a high chance that he will gain further fame in the future. Let’s hope that he will continue creating music, and that in the future he will become more successful and acclaimed as a solo artist.</p><p>So how rich is Gunplay? IT is estimated that Gunplay’s net worth is $1 million. He gained the biggest part of this sum of money while he was still a part of the “Triple C’s”. Of course, his recent activities as a solo artist have also added to his net worth. If he continues creating music and soon releases his first full studio album, there is a high chance that Gunplay’s net worth will become higher.</p><h3>Gunplay Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>Gunplay grew up in Florida, with his Jamaican mother. While still a teenager, he started selling drugs and caused many problems for his mother. It can be said that music saved his life as no one knows what Gunplay would be doing now, if he had not met <a href=#>Rick Ross</a>. Their interest in music made them think about creating their own band and start performing. In 2005 Gunplay with <a href=#>Rick Ross</a>, Young Breed and Torch, founded the band now known as the “Triple C’s”. Although the band was quite successful, they only released their first album in 2009 called “Custom Cars & Cycles”. It had a huge impact on the growth of Gunplay’s net worth and made his name known in the music industry.</p><p>Despite the fact that their album gained quite good reviews the band decided to go their separate ways, so in the same year Gunplay began his solo career. At first he produced mixtapes and also collaborated with <a href=#>Rick Ross</a> on his song called “Gunplay”. The mixtapes released by Gunplay became acclaimed and boosted his net worth. Not so long ago, Gunplay announced that he is working on his first studio album, which is planned to be released this year. Another thing that is worth knowing is that Gunplay is planning to change his stage name to “Don Logan”. It will be like a new start for him and his career as a solo artist. Undoubtedly his soon-to-be released album will gain a lot of success. Hopefully, Gunplay will continue his career for a long time.</p><p>If to talk about Gunplay’s personal life, it can be said that he was married once, but it ended in divorce. However, Gunplay has one child with his ex-wife. Controversy with the law has so far turned to nothing, despite drug use and suspicion of armed robbery. Still, Gunplay is a talented musician, who is still working hard to achieve acclaim and consistent success. Although the start of his career was not easy, he has been able to find one thing that he loves to do the most. Let’s hope that soon we will hear more about him.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqCsp6iclsZuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cinnamon-crunch-banana-bread-recipe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Healthy Cinnamon Crunch Banana Bread Recipe">&larr;
