She was born on January 4th, 1979, in San Jose, California, and grew up to be a strong, wise, and independent woman, thanks to the teachings of her parents. Jeannie has two younger brothers, Dennis and Daniel.</p><p>Jeannie Mai is a Capricorn who initially practiced Buddhism but later converted to Christianity. Despite facing various challenges, Jeannie’s unrelenting spirit and passion for helping others have made her a beloved public figure in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Despite being an American citizen, Jeannie’s heritage is deeply rooted in Asian culture. She is of Vietnamese and Chinese descent and speaks fluent Vietnamese and Spanish and English. Jeannie deeply respects and admires her mother’s birthplace and traditions, as her mother had come to the US by boat and was rescued by the US Navy.</p><p>Jeannie’s talents are diverse, from makeup artistry to styling to hosting.

Jeannie’s purpose in life is to reach out to those in need and lend a listening ear.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_582637-54 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_582637-54>Parents</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jeannie-Mai-Jenkins-parents-jpg.webp><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_b78f7a-f8 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_b78f7a-f8>Olivia Tu Tram Mai</h3><p>Jeannie Mai’s parents, Olivia Tu Tram Mai and her father, who is Chinese, raised their daughter in San Jose, California, instilling in her a deep appreciation for her Asian roots.</p><p>Jeannie’s relationship with her mother has been a roller-coaster ride. Olivia married her second husband, Ted, without informing her children, which surprised Jeannie and her siblings. Eight years later, the truth came to light when Jeannie found out that Uncle Ted was their stepfather.</p><p>Olivia and Ted’s relationship started in a chat room for single Vietnamese. After talking online for four months, they met in Houston, where they instantly clicked. They eventually got married, but they kept the news from their children, not knowing how they would react. Jeannie only learned about it eight years later and was happy for her mother.</p><p>However, their relationship was not always smooth sailing. Jeannie experienced abuse from a family member from nine until she was sixteen or seventeen. When she told her mother about it, Olivia didn’t believe her, which led to Jeannie running away from home when she was only sixteen. The two didn’t reconcile for eight years until Jeannie was twenty-four.</p><p>After their reconciliation, Jeannie explained everything to her mother, who then confronted Jeannie’s abuser.</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_0602d8-50 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_0602d8-50>James Mai</h3><p>Jeannie Mai’s father, James Mai, was Chinese, and her mother, Olivia, ran away with him at a young age due to her father’s mistreatment of her.

Despite their situation, they kept her and had two other children, Daniel and Dennis.</p><p>The details of Jeannie’s parents’ relationship after their separation are not widely known.
