He was happy [in his] home life, friends, family. I spoke to him on the Thursday, we were going for a drink on the Saturday. We had future plans.</p><p>"It's just unusual. He's vanished and we don't know where."</p><p>And Anthony's fiancee, Lucy Otto, has said he had "every intention" of coming home after the festive event.</p><p>She said: "If you're worried and you're thinking, 'Oh I can't come home, this is too big now', honestly, you don't realise how many people want you back regardless of the situation you left in - if that is the case.</p><p>"To be gone for this long, I just don't get it, I just do not understand it.</p><p>"I've been asked if there was any indication of depression or worries or troubles but I've racked my brains; there is nothing he said to me that would make me think he was in that frame of mind.</p><p>"I don't think that's an option that he's gone off and he's hurt himself."</p><p>Cops said he “may have come to harm” and have extended their search to include the area around an outdoor swimming pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/TM-map-Firefighter-New-v3.jpg><p>Lucy told The Sun: “The police are focusing on the water aspect and that he has fallen into the water, but I think there’s more to it.</p><p>“In my heart of hearts I think he has been taken or something. It just doesn’t make sense. I just want the police to start looking at different angles.</p><p>“The days are getting on now, they need to pull their finger out and start from the beginning.</p><p>“Where did he go after he left the pub? Something isn’t right, you can’t just walk out of a pub and never be seen again.</p><p>“I appreciate them searching the water, I really do. But it has been five days and they’ve come up with nothing.”</p><p>The firefighter had been pub-hopping with around a dozen colleagues and lost touch with them at around 7.20pm on December 20.</p><p>There has been no activity on Anthony’s phone since 7.20pm on December 20 and it has been off since 1am on Saturday, while his bank card has not been used.</p><p>On the day of the disappearance Lucy had dropped him off at another pub at 12.30pm where his last words to her were "love you, bye".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Anthony, of Orpington, Kent, is white, approximately 6ft and of medium build with medium-brown short gelled hair.</p><p>He was last seen wearing a black long-sleeve top, a dark denim suit-style jacket, dark denim jeans and black shoes.</p><p>His disappearance of is described as “very out of character” as friends say they are “really worried.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tm-lighten-4.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000550234325.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000549498195-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000550188329.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/grab1-1.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000549659950.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000549659951-1.jpg><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Coastguard and fire and rescue teams search the River Ouse for missing Anthony Knott</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdhboB5fJRoo5qrpGK2rq3GnmSonl2itrS%2FyKeeZp6Zp7Kntcahq56qXZa7tbTOp7Bmo56kwbV5wKxknKegqHqzscuemKydXZiwtcKMqaCcZZanvK55wZ6dqKqVYrWmedWapaKrmJqxbrvNZpqhqpmowa6t0manrppdmL%2Biw8to</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./danny-allen-obituary-learn-more-about-danny-allen-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Allen Obituary, Learn More About Danny Allen Death">&larr;
