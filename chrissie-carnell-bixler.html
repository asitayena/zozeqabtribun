She was born on April 19, 1979, which makes her 44 years old as of 2023. Chrissie has made her mark in the world of entertainment through her acting and modeling work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissie_Carnell_Bixler_Early_Life_and_Career></span><strong>Chrissie Carnell Bixler</strong> <strong>Early Life and Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chrissie’s journey into the world of modeling began at a young age. She appeared in renowned magazines like Seventeen, Glamour, and Elle, showcasing her talent and beauty. Later, in 1995, she made her debut in the horror film “Jack-O,” where she played the role of Julie Miller. This movie might not have received universal acclaim, but it earned a dedicated following among horror enthusiasts.</p><p>After high school, Chrissie took a leap of faith and headed to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of becoming an actor and model. Her determination led her to guest-starring roles in popular TV series like “Spin City” in 2000 and “That ’70s Show” in 2001. In the latter show, she had a unique connection as her past intertwined with one of the main actors, Danny Masterson, who portrayed Steven Hyde.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissie_Carnell_Bixler_Troubled_Relationship></span><strong><strong>Chrissie Carnell Bixler</strong> Troubled Relationship</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChrissieCarnell-BixlerCedricZavala-Bixler06022023-40-1a0c99a5f294415b9e851041e88e0c60-1024x1024-1.jpg><p>Chrissie Carnell-Bixler’s life took a complicated turn when she met Danny Masterson in 1996. Their relationship developed within the context of their shared involvement with the Church of Scientology. On the surface, their relationship seemed ideal, but behind closed doors, things were far from perfect.</p><p>Chrissie later revealed that during their relationship, Danny allegedly raped her multiple times. She claimed that he often used drugs or alcohol to incapacitate her before these incidents. Her fear of reporting these traumatic experiences to the authorities or the church stemmed from the belief that she would be labeled a “suppressive person” or an enemy of Scientology.</p><p>To make matters worse, Masterson allegedly threatened her with a gun and warned her not to disclose what had transpired. Their relationship eventually came to an end in 2002 when Chrissie discovered that Masterson had been unfaithful to her with other women.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Two_Decades_in_Scientology></span><strong>Two Decades in Scientology</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chrissie Carnell Bixler’s involvement with the Church of Scientology spanned two decades, starting during her teenage years. She grew up in a family deeply connected to the church, making it her primary community. However, her life took a painful turn due to the alleged abuse by Danny Masterson.</p><p>After enduring Masterson’s abuse, Chrissie attempted to report the incidents to church officials, but her allegations were dismissed. She was told that it was her fault for being unfaithful to him. The church also pressured her to undergo auditing sessions, a form of Scientology counseling. These sessions were traumatic and invasive, leaving Chrissie feeling powerless over her own life.</p><p>In 2016, she made the challenging decision to leave Scientology after watching the documentary series “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.” This eye-opening series exposed the church’s alleged abuses and scandals. Realizing she was not alone in her experiences, Chrissie also wanted to protect her children from the church’s influence.</p><p>However, leaving Scientology came at a high cost. She was declared a “suppressive person” by the church, resulting in her losing contact with everyone she had known and loved, including her mother. The trauma she endured left her struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, panic disorder, migraines, and severe pain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissie_Carnell_Bixler_Supportive_Husband_and_New_Beginnings></span><strong><strong>Chrissie Carnell Bixler</strong> Supportive Husband and New Beginnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After ending her relationship with Masterson, Chrissie Carnell met and fell in love with Cedric Bixler-Zavala, the lead singer of The Mars Volta and At the Drive-In. They tied the knot in 2009, making her Chrissie Bixler Zavala. Their family grew with the arrival of twin boys, Ulysses and Xanthus, in 2013.</p><p>Cedric Bixler-Zavala has been a pillar of support for his wife throughout her challenging journey. He openly criticized those he believed were protecting Masterson and Scientology. On Twitter, he expressed his frustration, accusing the LAPD, TMZ, and others of being influenced by the church.</p><p>After Masterson’s initial conviction, Bixler-Zavala took to Instagram to voice his support for his wife and the other survivors. He acknowledged their bravery in coming forward and seeking justice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/37490626-0-image-a-45_1609517630007-jpg-1908×1146-.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissie_Carnell_Bixler_Career></span><strong>Chrissie Carnell Bixler Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In addition to her modeling and acting career, Chrissie Bixler made a brief appearance in the popular TV show “That ’70s Show.” She featured in one episode titled “Eric’s Naughty No-No” during the fourth season. Interestingly, she portrayed a character named Chrissy who flirted with Eric Forman, played by Topher Grace.</p><p>Her connection to “That ’70s Show” became more complicated due to her past relationship with Danny Masterson, who portrayed Steven Hyde on the show. The relationship ended bitterly after her accusations of rape in 2001, a period when both were involved with Scientology.</p><p>Chrissie Carnell-Bixler later distanced herself from the church and emerged as a prominent critic of both Masterson and Scientology.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissie_Carnell_Bixler_Controversy></span><strong>Chrissie Carnell Bixler Controversy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ea79b6cde9c6797c2f0105300ff57b70.jpg><p>In a surprising turn of events, it was revealed that Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, who also starred in “That ’70s Show,” had written letters supporting Danny Masterson during his trial for rape. These letters were meant to vouch for his character and request a lighter sentence.</p><p>The public reaction to these letters was overwhelmingly negative, prompting both Kutcher and Kunis to issue apologies. However, Chrissie Bixler was far from pleased. She publicly called them out, accusing Ashton Kutcher of being privy to secrets kept by Masterson and suggesting that he was complicit in some way.</p><p>She also directed her criticism at Mila Kunis, urging her to reflect on her experiences during her time on the show and to watch her old interviews. Bixler suggested that Kunis might need therapy to process her relationship with Masterson during that period.</p><p>Chrissie Carnell Bixler’s journey has been marked by challenges, but her resilience, the support of her husband, and her determination to seek justice have made her a prominent figure in recent years. She continues to be an advocate for survivors of abuse and a voice for change.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chrissie_Carnell_Bixler_Social_Media_Accounts></span><strong><strong>Chrissie Carnell Bixler</strong></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Social Media Accounts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span><strong>Conclusion</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chrissie Carnell Bixler’s life has been a rollercoaster ride of success, struggles, and resilience. From her early career in modeling and acting to her traumatic experiences within Scientology and her fight for justice, her story is one of courage and determination.</p><p>Today, Chrissie stands as a symbol of strength, supporting survivors of abuse and advocating for change within the Church of Scientology.
