Judd Nelson became famous as part of a group of Gen X performers known as the "Brat Pack." He is best known for his roles in the 1985 coming-of-age films "The Breakfast Club" and "St. Elmo's Fire." Nelson has also appeared on television in such shows as the musical drama "Empire" and the NBC sitcom "Suddenly Susan."</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Judd Asher Nelson was born in 1959 in Portland, Maine to a Jewish family. He has two sisters, Julie and Eve. His mother, Merle, was a court mediator and former member of the Maine House of Representatives, while his father, Leonard, was a corporate attorney and the first Jewish president of the Portland Symphony Orchestra. During his childhood, Nelson attended Waynflete School in Portland, as well as St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Later, he enrolled at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, but dropped out his sophomore year. Afterward, he moved to Manhattan, where he studied acting under legendary acting teacher Stella Adler.</p><p>Nelson made his film debut in 1983 in "Rock 'n' Roll Hotel." The next year, he starred in the teen comedy "Making the Grade," and in early 1985, appeared opposite <a href=# title="Kevin Costner Net Worth">Kevin Costner</a> in the fraternity comedy "Fandango."</p><h2 id=brat-pack-1980s-movie-stardom><strong>The Brat Pack and 1980s Movie Stardom</strong></h2><p>Shortly following "Fandango," Nelson had his claim to fame with the release of the <a href=# title="John Hughes Net Worth">John Hughes</a> high school classic "The Breakfast Club." Nelson played John Bender, a rebellious punk who spends a day in detention with four other students â€“ played by <a href=# title="Emilio Estevez Net Worth">Emilio Estevez</a>, <a href=# title="Molly Ringwald Net Worth">Molly Ringwald</a>, <a href=# title="Anthony Michael Hall Net Worth">Anthony Michael Hall</a>, and <a href=# title="Ally Sheedy Net Worth">Ally Sheedy</a> â€“ each from a different clique. Later on, thanks to an article in New York Magazine, the media began referring to Nelson and his costars as the "Brat Pack."

Moreover, the "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)" music video, also featuring Nelson, reached number one in the US.</p><p>Following the one-two punch of "The Breakfast Club" and "St. Elmo's Fire," Nelson lent his voice to the animated film "The Transformers: The Movie," and reunited with Brat Pack star Ally Sheedy for the action thriller "Blue City." Among Nelson's other films from the 1980s were the courtroom comedy "From the Hip," the crime thriller "Relentless," and the <a href=# title="Tommy Chong Net Worth">Tommy Chong</a> comedy "Far Out Man."
